# Python & It's libraries

This week we will start by learning about Python language and libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib which are extensively used in Machine Learning and Data Analysis domains.

Basic idea is to familiarise yourself with power and utlities of these libraries.

Like most part of this project, This week will be based on hands-on-experience code because we believe that some intuitions are best developed via trial and error, tweaking the code in small ways and observing the results.

Using online python environments like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is encouraged.

Python is a great general-purpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing.
