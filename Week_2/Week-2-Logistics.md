# Basics of Machine Learning

This week we will start by learning about Logistic Regression Models, Data Preprocessing and Word Vectorisation. 

Understanding the basics of simple machine learning models is crucial for our initial steps toward their implementation. Preprocessing plays a vital role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our data. In this project, our goal is to create a sentiment analysis model, and one key aspect is Word Vectorization, which allows us to transform text data into numerical data.

Using online python environments like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is encouraged.
