- This is the official repository for BCS-FAP (Brain and Cognitive Society of IIT Kanpur's Freshers Amatuer Project) - Opinion Mining
- Discord will be our primary means of communication with time to time updates being posted on WhatsApp, join the [BCS server](https://discord.gg/zZQbZcu29f)
- Mentors of the project are:
1. [Raghav Manglik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghav-manglik-331326272/)
2. [Srishti Chandra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srishti-chandra-a79a3227a/)

- The Aim of this project is to create a **Sentimental Analysis Model** using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Neural Networks.
This project will also act as first exposure for the mentees to the world of Machine Learning.

## Tentative timeline - 5-6 weeks

- Week 1 - Basics of Python, Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Week 2 - Basics of  Machine Learning - Implementation of Regression Models and Data Preprocessing & Visualisation. 
- Week 3 - Basics of Machine Learning - Naive Bayes Classifier.
- Week 4 - Training different Models to analyse Sentiment of the dataset.
- Week 5 - Analysing Results and comparing different models, Understanding errors and fine-tuning to get better results.
- Week 6 - (Tentative) Applying learnt skills to accomplish tasks like completing analogies and translating words.
