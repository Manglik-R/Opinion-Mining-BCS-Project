- Week 3 - Basics of Machine Learning - Data Preprocessing and Visualisation, Word Vectorisation Basics.
- Week 4 - Training Logistic Regression Model and Naive Bayes Model to analyse Sentiment.
- Week 5 - Analysing Results and Understanding errors and fine-tuning to get better results.
- Week 6 - (Tentative) Applying learnt skills to accomplish tasks like completing analogies and translating words.
